A simple interface to the TM1638 based displays for the Raspberry Pi.

Dealextreme, doubtless amongst others, sell small boards with eight
seven-segment displays, eight red-green LEDs and eight push buttons
for less than $10.

The boards are basically just the LEDs and switches, and a TM1638
driver chip. This sits on a two-wire serial bus which makes it
fairly easy to connect the boards to a computer/microcontroller of
your choice. Of course, one needs a little bit of software. This is
such a library for the Raspberry Pi.

You can grab the code from github https://github.com/Stricted/pi-tm1638/tree/banana-pi

Checkout the code (needs autotools):
	git clone https://github.com/Stricted/pi-tm1638.git --branch banana-pi
	autoreconf -vfi
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

you can get WiringBP/WiringPi for the banana pi or banana pro here https://github.com/LeMaker/WiringBP/
	
If you've got doxygen installed, you'll find docs in doc/html. Otherwise
